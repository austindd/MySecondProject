            <h2>The Iliad</h2>
            <p>The Iliad (also known as the Song of Ilion or Song of Ilium) is an ancient Greek epic poem in dactylic
                hexameter, traditionally attributed to Homer. Set during the Trojan War, the ten-year siege of the city of
                Troy (Ilium) by a coalition of Greek states, it tells of the battles and events during the weeks of a
                quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles.</p>

            <h2>The Odyssey</h2>
            <p> The Odyssey is, in part, a sequel to the Iliad. The poem mainly focuses on the Greek hero Odysseus (known
                as Ulysses in Roman myths), king of Ithaca, and his journey home after the fall of Troy. It takes Odysseus
                ten years to reach Ithaca after the ten-year Trojan War. In his absence, it is assumed Odysseus has
                died, and his wife Penelope and son Telemachus must deal with a group of unruly suitors, the Mnesteres
                (Greek: Μνηστῆρες) or Proci, who compete for Penelope's hand in marriage. </p>

            <h2>The Oresteia</h2>
            <p>The Oresteia is a trilogy of Greek tragedies written by Aeschylus in the 5th
                century BC, concerning the murder of Agamemnon by Clytaemnestra, the murder of Clytaemnestra by Orestes,
                the trial of Orestes, the end of the curse on the House of Atreus and pacification of the Erinyes. The
                trilogy—consisting of Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides—also shows how the Greek gods
                interacted with the characters and influenced their decisions
                pertaining to events and disputes. The only extant example of an ancient Greek theatre trilogy, the
                Oresteia won first prize at the Dionysia festival in 458 BC. Many consider the Oresteia to be Aeschylus'
                finest work.</p>

            <h2>The Divine Comedy</h2>
            <p>The Divine Comedy is widely considered to be the preeminent work in Italian literature[1] and one of the
                greatest works of world literature. The poem's imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of the
                medieval world-view as it had developed in the Western Church by the 14th century. It is divided into three
                parts: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. The narrative describes Dante's travels through Hell, Purgatory,
                and Paradise or Heaven, while allegorically the poem represents the soul's journey towards God.</p>
